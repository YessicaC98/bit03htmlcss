    <ul>
    <li>Born Name: Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler </li>
    <li>Born Date: November 9, 1914</li>
    <li>Died: January 19, 2000</li>
    <li>Citizenship: Austria and USA</li>
    <li>Profession: Mathematician </li>
    <li>Ocuppation: Hollywood pinup- Inventor</li>
    <li>The mathematically talented Lamarr was born in Austria in 1914 and moved to the US in 1937 to start a Hollywood career.
        Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, she was considered one of cinema's leading ladies and made numerous films; however, her passion for engineering is far less known today.</li>
    <li>Invention: Frequency hopping spread spectrum, a technology still used for GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</li>
    <li>Her frequency hopping was initially employed by her to fight the Nazis.</li>
    <li>In 1997 she was awarded the Pioneer Award. </li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="aside">Frequency hopping story
     <p> In 1941, with half the world at war, he wanted to do his bit. Together with composer George Antheil he developed a system to improve the 
        radio communication of the British submarines, which ended up destroyed before the superiority of the Germans. </p>
    <p>How could he make radio communications secure so that submarines would not be intercepted by German torpedoes? It was then that he found the prelude to frequency jumping, a secret communication system to avoid interference and make guided missiles possible. The patent was classified as top secret and was not immediately used.</p>
    <p>In 1962 his patent was first used in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and later in Vietnam. It also played a predominant role in the American satellite defense system (Milstar), until in the 1980s, the expanded spectrum system saw its first contributions in civil engineering.</p> 
        From here, with the irruption of digital technology, the frequency jump allowed to implement data communication by Wifi. It also makes it possible to have a conversation by mobile phone in a room where there is another mobile, connect two devices via Bluetooth or that a mobile receives GPS coordinates from a satellite.
